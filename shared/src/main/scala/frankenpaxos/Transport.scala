// # Overview
// A fundamental part of any distributed system is the ability for actors (aka
// nodes, processes) to send messages to other actors. There are many ways that
// actors can send messages to one another. Here are a few:
//
//   - Actors can send messages over the network using TCP.
//   - Actors can send messages over the network using UDP.
//   - If two actor are co-located on the same physical machine, they can send
//     messages through a shared file.
//
// Ideally, we could write a distributed system without having to worry about
// the lower-level details of exactly how messages are sent. The Transport
// class is designed to do exactly this. Actors in a distributed system can
// send and receive messages using a Transport object without having to know
// concretely how the Transport object is sending messages.
//
// We associate every actor with a unique address. The type of this address is
// dependent on the implementation of the Transport. For example, a Transport
// that sends messages over the network using TCP would probably use an (IP
// address, port number) pair as an address, while a different kind of
// Transport would probbaly use some other kind of address.
//
// Actors---specifically, subclasses of Actor---implicitly call the
// Transport#register method to register themselves with a transport. This
// allows them to receive messages from the Transport. Similarly, actors use
// the Transport#send method to send messages to other actors.
//
// # Timers
// Transport objects allow actors to send and receive messages. They also allow
// actors to set timers, using the Transport#timer method. By setting timers,
// an actor can run a lambda function after a set amount of time.
//
// # Threading
// All Transport implementations MUST be single-threaded. Actor `receive`
// methods and timer callbacks must be called serially on a single thread.
//
// TODO(mwhittaker): Transports should have a `start` method so that actors can
// finish construction before the transport starts up. They should probably
// also have a `waitForTermination` function or something similar.
