// # MultiPaxos
// MultiPaxos replicas agree on a log by committing one log entry at a time.
// Initially, the log is empty:
//
//       0   1   2   3   4   5
//     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
//     |   |   |   |   |   |   |
//     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
//
// Over time, log entries are committed. Here, we illustrate that a log entry
// is committed by drawing an X in it. This is what it looks like when log
// entry 2 is committed:
//
//       0   1   2   3   4   5
//     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
//     |   |   | X |   |   |   |
//     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
//
// When a log entry is committed and all previous log entries are committed, we
// say the log entry is _eligible_ for execution. Replicas execute log
// entries in increasing order: 0, then 1, then 2, and so on. Of course, a
// replica can only execute a log entry if it is eligible. In the example
// above, no log entries are eligible yet. Imagine log entry 0 is committed
// next:
//
//       0   1   2   3   4   5
//     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
//     | X |   | X |   |   |   |
//     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
//
// 0 is eligible and is executed. Then, imagine log entry 1 is committed.
//
//       0   1   2   3   4   5
//     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
//     | X | X | X |   |   |   |
//     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
//
// Log entries 1 and 2 are now eligible and can be executed (in order).
//
// # EPaxos, BPaxos, etc.
// Instead of agreeing on a _log_ one _entry_ at a time, some state machine
// replication protocols (like EPaxos and BPaxos) agree on a _graph_ one
// _vertex_ at a time. Initially, the graph is empty. Over time, vertices are
// committed and added to the graph. For example, imagine vertex B is committed
// with an edge to vertex A. That looks like this.
//
//
//       +---+
//     A | X |
//       +---+
//        |
//        |
//        v
//       +---+
//     B |   |
//       +---+
//
// Note that vertex A is committed, but vertex B is not. We say a vertex is
// _eligible_ for execution if it and every vertex reachable from it is
// committed. In the example above, no vertex is eligible. Now, imagine that
// vertex C is committed with an edge to A.
//
//       +---+      +---+
//     A | X |<-----| X | C
//       +---+      +---+
//        |
//        |
//        v
//       +---+
//     B |   |
//       +---+
//
// Still, no vertex is eligible. Now, imagine vertex B is committed with an
// edge to A.
//
//       +---+      +---+
//     A | X |<-----| X | C
//       +---+      +---+
//        | ^
//        | |
//        v |
//       +---+
//     B | X |
//       +---+
//
// Now, all three vertices are eligible. Like how MultiPaxos executes log
// entries in prefix order, protocols like EPaxos and BPaxos execute commands
// in "prefix order". More carefully, they execute strongly connected
// components of eligible commands in reverse topological order.
//
// In the example above, vertices A and B form a strongly connected component
// and vertex C forms a strongly connected component. Thus, the protocol
// executes the A,B component and then the C component. Within a component, the
// protocol is free to execute commands in an arbitrary order that respects
// sequence numbers (we omitted sequence numbers in this example to keep things
// simple). For example, if both A and B have the same sequence number, then
// EPaxos can execute commands in either of the following orders:
//
//   - A, B, C
//   - B, A, C
//
// but NOT in any of the following orders:
//
//   - C, A, B
//   - C, B, A
//   - A, C, B
//   - B, C, A
//
// All implementations of DependencyGraph here return commands within a
// component sorted first by sequence number and then by vertex key. So, the
// above graph would be executed as A, B, C.
//
// # API
// Note that vertex identifiers and sequence numbers are both generic. This is
// because EPaxos and BPaxos use different types of vertex identifiers, and
// BPaxos doesn't even use sequence numbers. The key and sequence number
// orderings are used to execute commands within a component in a deterministic
// order.
